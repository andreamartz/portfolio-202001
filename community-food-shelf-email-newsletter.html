            <p>Amy and I are both concerned about social justice issues. We had several ideas for potential themes, but we both liked
            the idea of creating a community newsletter for a nonprofit, and we settled on doing it for a fictional local food
            shelf.</p>
            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>The target audience is residents in the geographic area served by the food shelf who have connected in some way with it
            in the past and shared their email address. These people include current and past donors of food or money as well as
            current and past volunteers.</p>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>The purpose of the newsletter is to engage community members by showing them the ways they can make a difference for
            their neighbors in need and inspiring them to contribute.</p>

            <p>Andrea drew inspiration from her community’s food pantry VEAP (Volunteers Enlisted to Assist People) in Bloomington, MN
            and proposed a list of possible ways that community members could help a food shelf.</p>

            <h2>Design: Layout</h2>
            <p>We wanted to have an attractive and streamlined layout for our content. With this in mind, we researched several real
            email newsletters to find inspiration. The newsletter below from Charity: Water inspired the creation of our wireframe.</p>
            <p>Inspiration</p>

            <h2>Design: Style</h2>
            <p>All fonts and icons were chosen to give a modern, yet simple look to keep the focus on the message of the newsletter.
            The primary font used was Cuprum, but other sans serif fonts were also used for slight variation.</p>
            <p>We chose the colors with our theme and audience in mind from the palettes at Colorhunt (https://colorhunt.co/)</p>
            <div>
              <!-- Color this div #57A99A and make it a horizontal rectangle -->
            </div>
            <div>
              <!-- Color this div #D1EECC and use border-radius to make it a circle -->
            </div>
            <p>Green evokes thoughts of health, growth, and generosity and makes us feel peaceful.</p>
            <div>
              <!-- Color this div #76DBD1 and use border-radius to make it a circle -->
            </div>
            <p>Blue brings to mind trust, strength, stability, and dependability.  We chose a greenish blue since green is an important 
              color for our message.</p>
            
            <div>
