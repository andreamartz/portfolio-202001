Get to know Andrea and see her portfolio of work at https://andreamartz.github.io

This webpage was built entirely by Andrea using mostly vanilla CSS3 and Javascript.  The slider images and nav bar, though, do involve some Bootstrap.

## Acknowledgements

The slider section of the page was built following Reece Kenney's Udemy course titled:  
"Make a Responsive Portfolio Website: JavaScript and HTML."  
The slider photos and text were chosen by Andrea.  

The rest of the page, including the color palette, was designed by Andrea Martz.
